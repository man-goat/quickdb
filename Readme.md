# what is this?

Quickly spin up database instance with test data defined in json file.
Derive schema from the json file, somehow...

This is a stupid idea.

Steps:
* spin up db server (optional)
    * is docker truly necessary
* create new db
* read json file(s?) and determine schema. somehow.
    * how will it determine FKs, PKs, etc? lol
    * lol
* create tables and shit
* load data into db
